# TL;DR

LLM agents fail in complex environments because they lack specific capabilities — but when training with RL directly on the target environment, the reward signal doesn't reveal which underlying capabilities the agent lacks. **TRACE** (Turning Recurrent Agent failures into Capability-targeted training Environments) is an end-to-end system for environment-specific agent self-improvement that automatically identifies an agent's capability deficits, synthesizes targeted training environments for each, and trains lightweight LoRA adapters via RL. TRACE improves over the base agent by **+14.1 points** on &tau;<sup>2</sup>-Bench and **+7 perfect scores** on ToolSandBox, outperforming the strongest baseline by **+7.4 points** and **+4 perfect scores**.

## Overview

LLM agents in environments like customer service or tool use must exercise multiple capabilities across different tasks. A natural approach is to train the agent directly on the target environment via RL — but the reward signal doesn't reveal which underlying capabilities the agent lacks, making learning sparse and sample-inefficient. TRACE decomposes the problem into four steps:

1. **Capability Selection.** Roll out the base agent, then contrast successful and failed trajectories to identify the specific capabilities the agent lacks.
2. **Synthetic Environment Generation.** For each identified capability deficit, synthesize a targeted training environment that isolates and rewards exercising that capability.
3. **GRPO Training.** Train a lightweight LoRA adapter on each capability-specific synthetic environment via RL.
4. **Select & Adapt.** At inference, route each task to the relevant LoRA adapter using the base model as a classifier.

## Main Results

We evaluate TRACE using Qwen3-30B-A3B on two benchmarks: **&tau;<sup>2</sup>-Bench** (customer service with Airline and Retail domains) and **ToolSandBox** (stateful tool use, 129 scenarios).

On **&tau;<sup>2</sup>-Bench**, even a **single adapter** trained on one synthesized capability environment surpasses direct GRPO on the target environment, GEPA (evolutionary prompt optimization), and methods that curate general-purpose synthetic agentic data and environments (ADP and AWM). Combining multiple capability-specific adapters with routing, TRACE achieves the strongest results on both benchmarks.

## Scaling Behavior

### Scaling with Number of Rollouts

TRACE scales more efficiently with training rollouts than both GRPO (direct RL on the target environment) and GEPA (evolutionary prompt optimization). On &tau;<sup>2</sup>-Bench, TRACE shows consistent, monotonic improvement up to **47.0%** at 5,120 rollouts, while GRPO stalls at 37.8% and GEPA plateaus at 39.6%. A consistent trend appears on ToolSandBox.

### Scaling with Number of Capabilities

TRACE continues to improve as more capability-specific adapters are added, reaching **47.0%** with 4 capabilities. In contrast, GEPA's prompt-based approach plateaus quickly — demonstrating that explicitly training on capability-targeted environments enables more significant gains.
